Smartphone Lens kit - The macro lens screws onto the telephoto lens. Happy accident on my part.

Small stepper and driver (camera)
*if you want to avoid buying the Nema 17 Stepper and the A4988 driver above for the turntable, you can use this turntable design, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3958326, and use two of these small steppers instead. I found this to be slightly underpowered, and it skipped steps with heavier objects. That's why I upgraded to a larger motor.
